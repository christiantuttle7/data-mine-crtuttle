#### Date: 9/4/2025
#### Project: Automate Data Source
 Description: This program takes in weather data for Grand Junction, including temperature, humidity, 
 precipitation, etc. It creates a streamlit app, lets the user choose a time window (within the past 14 days)
 and provides tables and graphs. 
 Note: This follows very closely to the colorado river example. 
 Im guessing that is ok based off the assignment description
